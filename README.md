# To-Do List Application

This is a simple yet functional To-Do List web application developed to practice basic front-end web development concepts.

The application allows users to manage their daily tasks with features such as adding, editing, deleting, completing, and filtering tasks. Tasks are stored using the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks (All / Active / Completed)
- Keyboard support (Enter, Escape)
- Persistent storage using LocalStorage

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How It Works
- Users can add tasks using the input field or by pressing Enter.
- Tasks can be marked as completed using a checkbox.
- Tasks can be edited inline.
- Tasks can be filtered based on their status.
- All tasks are saved in the browser's local storage.

## Project Purpose
This project was created for learning and practice purposes to improve front-end development skills and understand DOM manipulation and local storage usage.
